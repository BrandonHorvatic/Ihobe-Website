    <h1>Profit Science Liquid</h1>

            <p>The application of Profit Science Liquid is based on 4 simple steps:</p>
                <li>
                    Step 1: Preparation of haul road as per international mine haul road specification
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 2: Pre-treatment application
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 3: Provide efficient time for the product to cure
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 4: Apply maintenance applications
                </li>

            <p>The simplicity of the product allows the mine to now become in control of their operations as they could either:</p>
            <li>
                Apply product themselves
            </li>
            <li>
                Promote a social development program, or
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a mine contractor to apply product
            </li>

            <p>The innovative development of this product has eliminated a few of the common issues found with some of the common dust palliatives as well as problems which we ourselves have faced in the past which leads to instability and inconsistency in the product. These issues include product washout and poor traction under rainfall, and melting of product under intense heat.</p>

            <p>Currently with the increasing effects of climate change, mine operations are being exposed to erratic weather patterns. Most of the traditional dust palliatives are not suitable within the full spectrum of weather conditions, which is what makes Profit Science Liquid so unique.</p>

            <p>Some of the main benefits of the development of Profit Science Liquid are:</p>
            <li>
                No leaching or bleeding of product
            </li>
            <li>
                Biodegradable 
            </li>
            <li>
                Ultra-hydrophobic and super concentrated
            </li>
            <li>
                No specialised equipment requirements
            </li>
            <li>
                Limiting the carbon footprint in comparison to traditional dust palliatives
            </li>
